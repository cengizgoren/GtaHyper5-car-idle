# GtaHyper5
This is a hypercasual version prototype of the GTA 5 mod that is popular in yt shorts. I just wanted to see if it would be fun so I made this prototype but I won't finish it.
I used Probuilder and other free assets to prototype. 
## How To Play
The goal is to reach the finish line as fast as you can. You should keep the car on the platform.
